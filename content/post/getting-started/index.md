```python

```

## Overview
It has been one month since the end of the postgraduate guarantee on September 28, and I intend to share some of my own journey and feelings as a personal blog.
I probably sent applications to a total of more than 20 schools, then participated in about 10 universities, but gave up a few, finally got 4 best offers.
从9月28日保研结束至今已经有一个月的时间了，打算将自己的一些历程和感悟分享出来，当作个人博客。
我大概一共投递了20多所学校，入营了10多所，又放弃了几所不是很心仪的，最终拿到优营4所。

## Get Started
我打算只记录以下几所高校的一些记忆和体会：
- Central Sounth University 中南大学
- Sun Yat-sen University 中山大学
- Tongji University 同济大学
- Beijing Normal University 北京师范大学
- Zhejiang University 浙江大学


## Central Sounth University

我想提中南大学是因为这是我第一个参加面试的学校。整个面试下来，给我的感受就是——比较顺利。

## Sun Yat-sen University

## Tongji University

## Beijing Normal University

## Zhejiang University
